Answer the following questions on Separate Chaining Hash table for the keys and its hash values.
Keys : S E A R C H E X A M P L E
Hash : 2 0 0 4 4 4 0 2 0 4 3 3 0
Note: If there are no keys write null, If there are multiple keys write keys with comma space separated

For the index 0, Write the keys in ascending order.

A,E

For the index 4, Write the keys in ascending order.

C,H,M,R

For the index 1, Write the keys in ascending order.

null

For the index 2, Write the keys in ascending order.

S,X

For the index 3, Write the keys in ascending order
L,P

After Inserting elements 1, 32, 22, 15, 33, 45, 66, 73, 10. How many collisions occur when you hashCode() as key % size after inserting keys into hashtable for given sizes below.

Size = 7 
1%7=1
32%7=4
22%7=1
15%7=1
33%7=5
45%7=3
66%7=3
73%7=3
10%7=3
here 45,66,73,10 had collision at index 3.
here 22,15,1 had collision at index 1.

Size = 8
1%8=1
32%8=0
22%8=6
15%8=7
33%8=1
45%8=3
66%8=2
73%8=1
10%8=2
here 1,33,73 had collision at index 1.
here 66,10 had collisions at index 2.

Size = 12
1%12=1
32%12=6
22%12=11
15%12=3
33%12=7
45%12=9
66%12=6
73%12=1
10%12=1
here 1,73,10 had collision at index 1.

Size = 1
1%1=0
32%1=0
22%1=0
15%1=0
33%1=0
45%1=0
66%1=0
73%1=0
10%1=0
here 1,32,22,15,33,45,66,73,10 had collision at index 0.

In a separate-chaining hash table with M lists and N keys, the number of compares (equality tests) for search and insert is proportional to N/M. (true/false)
A.TRUE

Any good hash function should have the three properties :  (true/false)

It should be deterministic, equal keys must produce the same hash value.

It should be efficient to compute.

It should uniformly distribute the keys.
A.TRUE
